            <h3>Feta Veggie Quiche</h3>
            <p>This is a basic recipe that can be adapted to your tastes, or (more likely, in my case) what's getting
                old in the fridge. To make it easier, I use a bought pie crust, but homemade would definitely make it
                better!</p>

            <h3>Fresh Peach Cake</h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl and beat with
                an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat well after each addition.</p>
